# github - Revisions and the Cloud

### we use Github is platform where we can share our websites and works.
## so just like an online colaboration tool to share our projects so it's just like a container to save our codes 
# in order to have a modified version of our codes we have at first to make a Repo then :
* **open the file using UBUNTU using the clone command and copying the link through Git**
* in order to track the repo files we should use the command **git add** and this to bring out the changes from VSCode. 
* in order to make sure that the changes are up to date use the command **git status**
* and to add a comment of your changes to assist you in next times we have to use the commant **commit -m "this is my comment"**
* to push and share our changes we have to use the command **git push origin main** 
* the link will be automatically generated and you can use it once again 
*
